# Yahtzee
Yahtzee GUI using ImGui

ImGui Source: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui

If you do not have Microsoft Visual Studio C++ installed use the .exe file in the release folder, otherwise, it'll want some runtime .dll file.

Please don't sue me Yahtzee, i'm not making any money off of this.

This project was inspired by my favorite teacher... too bad he is no longer working at my school :(...

I'm not very good at coding so if anyone has any tips i'm all ears!

The game functions just how Yahtzee is played, you can lock dice to prevent them from being rolled again and you can roll a total of 3 times, the first of which you cannot lock any dice. Please let me know if there are any issues.
